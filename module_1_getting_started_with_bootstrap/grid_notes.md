# Grid Notes
* Always 12 columns.

* Smaller sizes set the default values for larger sizes.  
  
  * col-sm would set the size for small, medium and large screens unless overridden by a setting specific to one of the larger sizes.

* There is a 30px `gutter`, or empty space, between each column (15px on each side of the column).

* The gutter outside of the container varies based on the current screen size.  
  
  * Extra small devices usually always use the width of the screen.

* Changes in screen size are not by javascript but by media query of css.
